# Analysis for School Board
A local school board has requested an analysis of math and reading scores to determine if there has been academic dishonesty at Thomas High School, specifically in the ninth grade.

## Overview of Project
Two analyses were conducted. One with all of the original data, and another with reading and math scores removed for ninth graders at Thomas High School.
